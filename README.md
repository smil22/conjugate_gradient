# conjugate_gradient
Solve a [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) by the [conjugate gradient algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method). <br>
You will need basic knwoledges in numpy module manipulation to set your system.

> [!NOTE]
> Numpy and Scipy are required.
